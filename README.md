**CodeWorks** is an online Java compiler and editor.

It allows you to run Java code in a sandbox, or to practice and learn programming by solving preset programming problems.


We developed this fun and amibtious project during the [GreatUniHack](http://greatunihack.com/)
hackathon, where it won the Web Applications UK challenge; the idea was to build a website that
helps young people, in our case it helps people learn programming.
